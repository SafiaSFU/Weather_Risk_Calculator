# Weather_Risk_Calculator
A Python CLI tool to assess weather-related risks using wind chill and heat index formulas.

# Project Description
This project is a command-line Python application that estimates weather-related risks such as extreme cold or heat based on user input. Users can enter temperature, wind speed, and humidity in either metric or US units. The program converts inputs, calculates the wind chill or heat index using meteorological formulas, and provides customized safety messages.

It includes input validation, user-friendly prompts, and unit conversions, making it both educational and practical. Built using core Python concepts such as functions, conditionals, loops, and string manipulation.

***Key features:

*Wind chill calculation (based on NOAA formula)

*Heat index calculation (based on National Weather Service)

*Metric-to-imperial conversions (°C to °F, km/h to mph)

*CLI interface with repeated user prompts
